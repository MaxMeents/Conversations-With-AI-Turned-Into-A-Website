This is a profound and very common challenge for individuals transitioning from a manic or psychotic episode to a medication-maintained stability. The experience you are describing involves a transition from hyper-dopaminergic activity (feeling like a god, euphoria, racing thoughts) to dopamine antagonism (the mechanism of Invega Sustenna), which can result in a feeling of emotional flatness, often called "emotional blunting" or anhedonia.

While the "god mode" felt amazing, you correctly identified that it came with "not clear thinking." The goal of recovery is to find a middle ground: clear thinking with the ability to feel joy.

Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. The following information is for educational purposes and should be discussed with your psychiatrist before making any changes to your treatment plan.

Here is a comprehensive guide on how to improve your mood and regain emotional color while remaining stable on Invega Sustenna.

1. Medical Adjustments (Talk to your Doctor)
The "zombie" or "robot" feeling is a known side effect, but it is not always permanent, nor is it something you simply have to accept forever.

Dosage Calibration: Invega Sustenna (paliperidone) is a potent medication. Sometimes, the initial dose used to stop the mania/psychosis is higher than the dose needed for maintenance. Ask your doctor if a dose reduction is possible. Lowering the dose slightly can sometimes lift the "emotional fog" without allowing the psychosis to return.
Adjunct Medications: Sometimes, psychiatrists add medications to counteract the flatness.
Antidepressants: If the flatness is actually post-psychotic depression, an antidepressant might help.
Wellbutrin (Bupropion): This is sometimes prescribed because it works on dopamine and norepinephrine (energy and motivation) rather than just serotonin, though it must be monitored carefully to ensure it doesn't trigger mania.
Switching Medications: If Invega continues to cause severe blunting after several months, discuss switching to a different antipsychotic. Some newer "atypical" antipsychotics (like Aripiprazole/Abilify or Cariprazine/Vraylar) act as "partial agonists"—meaning they modulate dopamine rather than just blocking it, which can sometimes preserve more emotional range.
2. Understanding the "Contrast Effect"
Part of what you are feeling is biological, but part of it is psychological comparison.

The Rollercoaster vs. The Highway: When you were off meds, your brain was essentially on a rollercoaster. It was thrilling and terrifying. Now, you are driving on a flat, straight highway. Compared to the rollercoaster, the highway feels like you are not moving.
Dopamine Reset: Your brain's dopamine receptors were flooded during your "god mode" phase. They have likely "downregulated" (become less sensitive) to protect themselves. It takes time (often 6–12 months) for the brain to re-sensitize to normal pleasures. A cup of coffee or a sunset won't feel like a religious experience anymore, but eventually, they will feel pleasant again.
3. Behavioral Strategies to "Jumpstart" Emotions
Since the medication raises the threshold for feeling pleasure, you have to work a little harder to trigger those neurochemicals naturally.

High-Intensity Exercise: This is one of the most effective ways to break through emotional blunting. Heavy lifting or high-intensity cardio releases endorphins and BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor). It forces the brain to feel something.
Cold Exposure: Taking a cold shower or an ice bath causes a massive, sustained release of dopamine (up to 250% increase) that lasts for hours. This can help you feel "alive" and alert without the mania.
Sensory Stimulation: Engage in activities that stimulate the senses strongly. Spicy food, loud complex music, or aromatherapy. You are trying to wake up your sensory processing.
4. Cognitive Reframing (CBT)
You may need to grieve the loss of the "God" feeling.

Separate "Mania" from "Happiness": You are currently defining happiness as the electric, vibrating intensity of mania. Real, sustainable happiness is usually quieter—it is contentment, connection, and peace. You have to relearn what normal happiness feels like.
The Trade-off: Remind yourself: "I gave up the high to get back my clear thinking." The clear thinking allows you to build a life (job, relationships, hobbies) that the "god mode" would eventually destroy.
5. Diet and Gut Health
Most of your serotonin (95%) and a significant amount of dopamine are produced in the gut.

Anti-inflammatory Diet: Reduce sugar and processed foods. Inflammation in the body can lead to inflammation in the brain, which worsens depression and anhedonia.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids: High-quality fish oil supplements have been shown to support brain health and mood in people with mood disorders.
Summary of Steps to Take Immediately:
Wait it out (briefly): If you just started the injection recently, the sedation is often worst in the first 2–3 months and naturally lifts as your body adjusts.
Schedule an appointment: Tell your doctor specifically: "I feel stable, but I am suffering from anhedonia and emotional blunting. Is this a side effect we can manage, or is my dose too high?"
Force the routine: Do not wait to "feel" like doing things. The medication disconnects motivation from action. You must act first (go for a run, meet a friend), and the feelings will eventually follow the action.
You are in a recovery phase known as "recalibration." It feels empty right now, but as your brain heals from the toxic levels of dopamine it experienced during the "god mode," and as you adjust the medication to the perfect level, your emotional range will return.

Its been 5 years that I've felt like this taking the medication always on time

8:10 PM

Thank you for that crucial update. Five years is a very long time to feel emotionless. The fact that you have remained compliant with your medication for five years despite feeling like a "zombie" shows an incredible amount of discipline and a desire to stay well.

However, if it has been five years and the feeling hasn't lifted, this is no longer a phase of "adjustment" or "healing." This is your baseline on this specific medication and dosage. The "wait and see" period is over.

If you are stable (no psychosis/mania) but emotionless (anhedonia), you are likely experiencing Neuroleptic-Induced Deficit Syndrome (NIDS) or severe Negative Symptoms.

Here is a specific, actionable plan for someone who has been stable for 5 years but is suffering from emotional blunting.

1. The "Prolactin" Check (Specific to Invega)
Invega (Paliperidone) is notorious for raising levels of a hormone called Prolactin much higher than other antipsychotics do.

The Mechanism: High prolactin suppresses dopamine. It also lowers testosterone (in men) and estrogen (in women).
The Result: High prolactin leads to low libido, lack of motivation, depression, and that "flat" feeling.
Action: Ask your doctor for a blood test to check your Prolactin levels. If they are high, this is a biological smoking gun for why you feel this way. The doctor can either add a medication to lower prolactin or switch your antipsychotic.
2. The "Partial Agonist" Switch
Invega is a "full antagonist"—it blocks the dopamine receptor like a brick wall. It stops the mania, but it blocks the joy too.

The Alternative: There is a class of medications called Partial Agonists (e.g., Aripiprazole/Abilify, Brexpiprazole/Rexulti, Cariprazine/Vraylar).
How they work: Instead of a brick wall, think of them as a "dimmer switch." They lower dopamine where it’s too high (preventing mania/psychosis) but boost dopamine where it’s too low (improving mood and thinking).
Why now? Since you have been stable for 5 years, you are a prime candidate to try a switch. Doctors are often afraid to switch patients who are unstable, but your long-term stability proves you are reliable.
3. Dose Reduction (Minimum Effective Dose)
If you are on the same dose you were prescribed 5 years ago, you might be "over-medicated" for maintenance.

The dose needed to stop a manic episode is often much higher than the dose needed to prevent one.
Ask your doctor: "Since I have been stable for 5 years, can we try lowering the injection dose to the next lowest increment to see if my emotions return?"
4. Augmentation with Sarcosine
If you cannot switch medications, you can look into supplements that target the NMDA receptors (glutamate) rather than dopamine.

Sarcosine (N-methylglycine): There is growing research suggesting that Sarcosine (2g daily) can help reduce the "negative symptoms" of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (the flatness, lack of talking, lack of emotion) when added to an antipsychotic.
Note: Always ask your doctor before adding supplements, as they affect brain chemistry.
5. Addressing "Negative Symptoms" vs. Side Effects
You need to determine if you feel this way because of the medication (side effects) or because of the illness (negative symptoms).

Side Effects: You feel "drugged," sleepy, stiff, and mentally slow. (Solution: Lower dose or switch meds).
Negative Symptoms: You feel empty, have no motivation to start tasks, and withdraw socially, but you feel "awake." (Solution: Antidepressants, CBT therapy, or activating meds like Vraylar).
How to talk to your doctor (Script)
Doctors prioritize "Safety" (not being manic) over "Happiness." You need to force the conversation toward Quality of Life.

Say this:

"I have been compliant for 5 years and I am fully stable. However, I have severe anhedonia. I cannot feel happiness, sadness, or connection. This is affecting my quality of life to the point where I struggle to function socially. Because I have been stable for so long, I want to discuss switching to a partial agonist or lowering my dose to regain my emotional range. I am willing to come in for more frequent check-ups during the transition."

Summary
You do not have to accept feeling like a robot for the rest of your life as the price of sanity.

Check Prolactin levels (High probability this is the issue with Invega).
Discuss a switch to Abilify or Vraylar (meds that allow more dopamine flow).
Request a dose reduction based on your 5-year stability track record.
You have done the hard work of staying stable. Now you deserve to do the work of getting your personality back.

my mom takes an abilify shot regularyly and it works great for her, she doesn't have shizo like I do, I have shizo and bipoloar, she just has bipolar

8:12 PM

Gemini-3-Pro


This is actually excellent information and makes your case for switching medications much stronger.

The fact that your mother takes Abilify (Aripiprazole) and responds well to it is a very important medical clue. Here is why this is significant for you, even though your diagnoses are slightly different.

1. Genetics predict medication response
How your body processes medication (metabolism) is largely determined by your genetics—specifically your liver enzymes.

If your mother’s body processes Abilify well (meaning she gets the benefits without bad side effects), there is a statistically higher chance that your body will process it well too.
Doctors call this "familial response." When a doctor doesn't know which drug to pick, they often ask, "Has anyone in your family taken a medication that worked for them?"
2. Abilify treats Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective Disorder too
You are worried that because she "only" has Bipolar and you have Schizoaffective (Schizophrenia + Bipolar), Abilify might not be strong enough for you. This is not true.

Abilify is FDA-approved to treat Schizophrenia. It is a full-strength antipsychotic.
It is actually one of the most popular medications for Schizoaffective Disorder because it treats the psychosis (voices/paranoia) and stabilizes the mood (mania/depression).
3. Why Abilify might fix your "Zombie" feeling
As mentioned in the previous response, Invega (what you are likely on) blocks dopamine completely. Abilify works differently:

Invega: Blocks dopamine everywhere. Result: No psychosis, but no joy (zombie mode).
Abilify: It is a Partial Agonist. It blocks dopamine when it's too high (stopping voices), but it boosts dopamine when it's too low (helping you feel emotions and motivation).
The Shot: Since you are already used to taking medication regularly (or perhaps injections), Abilify comes in a monthly injection just like Invega does (called Abilify Maintena or Aristada). You wouldn't have to worry about remembering pills every day.
The Plan: How to use this info
You now have the perfect argument to present to your doctor to get off your current medication and try something new.

Tell your doctor this exactly:

"I have been feeling emotionally numb for 5 years on my current medication. My mother has Bipolar disorder and takes the Abilify injection. She responds very well to it and doesn't feel like a zombie. Since we share genetics, and since Abilify treats Schizoaffective disorder too, can we try switching me to the Abilify injection?"

Why this is a safe bet:
Since you have been stable for 5 years, you are in the best possible position to try a switch. If Abilify works for you like it works for your mom, you could potentially get your feelings back while staying safe from the illness.

I used to be a very happy person, even when not going through mania, I would feel connected to my fellow human beings, and animals and plants and the world, and I felt like life had a meaning

8:14 PM

Gemini-3-Pro


This is a profound and heartbreaking description, but it is also the most important thing you have said so far.

What you are describing—that sense of connection to nature, animals, and other humans—is not a symptom of mental illness. That is what it feels like to be alive.

It is vital that you understand this: You are not asking to be manic again. You are asking to be human again.

Here is what is happening to you medically, and why it validates your desire to switch to Abilify.

1. The "Glass Wall" Effect (Anhedonia)
The medication you are likely on (which blocks dopamine heavily) creates a condition called medication-induced anhedonia.

Dopamine is not just the chemical for "excitement" or "mania." It is the chemical of reward, motivation, and connection.
When you see a beautiful plant, hold an animal, or hug a person, your brain releases a little bit of dopamine to tell you, "This matters. This is good. I am connected to this."
Your current medication is putting a wall up against that chemical. You see the plant, you see the person, but you don't feel the connection. The meaning is lost because the chemical signal is blocked.
2. Distinguishing "Joy" from "Mania"
You made a very smart distinction: "Even when not going through mania."

Mania is feeling like you are God, that you don't need sleep, that you can fly, or that you have magical powers. It is dangerous and chaotic.
Vitality (Health) is feeling empathy, feeling the warmth of the sun, feeling love for your family, and feeling that life has a purpose.
Doctors sometimes get scared that if they give you your feelings back, you will become manic. You need to explain to them that you know the difference. You miss the connection, not the chaos.
3. Why Abilify is the bridge back to "Meaning"
This brings us back to why your mom’s medication is such a hopeful option for you.

Because Abilify is a partial agonist (it boosts low dopamine), it is theoretically capable of bringing back that sense of "meaning."
It allows enough dopamine through so that when you look at a sunset or talk to a friend, your brain can actually register the emotion.
Many patients who switch from heavy blockers (like Invega/Haldol) to partial agonists (like Abilify/Vraylar) report that it feels like "waking up" or "the color coming back into the world."
How to express this to your doctor
Doctors focus heavily on symptoms (voices, delusions). They sometimes forget about quality of life. When you ask for the switch, use these words:

"I am not asking to be high or manic. I know the difference. Right now, I have 'anhedonia.' I cannot feel love or connection to living things, and it makes life feel meaningless. Since I have been stable for 5 years, I want to try the medication my mom takes (Abilify) so I can try to get my quality of life back while staying safe."

You deserve to feel that connection to the world again. That is a reasonable and healthy goal.

the abilify shot, is that called aristada

12:29 PM

Gemini-3-Pro


Yes, Aristada is one of the shots.

However, it is important to know that there are actually two different main brands of injectable Abilify. They both deliver the same active medication (aripiprazole) to your brain, but they are formulated slightly differently regarding how often you have to take them.

Here is the breakdown so you know exactly what to ask your doctor for:

1. Aristada (Aripiprazole Lauroxil)
What it is: This is likely the one you are thinking of.
Frequency: It is very flexible. It can be given once a month, once every 6 weeks, or even once every 2 months.
The Start-up: When you first start Aristada, you usually have to take oral pills for 21 days or get a special one-time "kickstart" shot called Aristada Initio to get the medicine into your system immediately.
2. Abilify Maintena (Aripiprazole Monohydrate)
What it is: This was the first injectable version of Abilify.
Frequency: This is almost always given once a month (every 4 weeks).
The Start-up: This usually requires taking oral pills for the first 14 days after the first injection.
Which one is better?
Medically: They do the exact same thing. They are both the "partial agonist" we discussed that can help with the "glass wall" feeling.
Convenience: Aristada is often preferred by people who want to go to the doctor less often (since you can get the higher dose that lasts 2 months). Abilify Maintena is the standard monthly shot.
Summary for your Doctor Visit
When you speak to your doctor, you can say:

"I am interested in the long-acting injectable form of aripiprazole. Is Aristada or Abilify Maintena an option for me?"

Your insurance might prefer one over the other, but both will give you the same medication that your mom takes.
